abstract={This thesis covers techniques to improve wildfire detection accuracy through the use of spatial and temporal context. Our dataset of wildfires consists of high-resolution images with smoke plumes that need to be detected early, when they are smallest, to allow firefighters enough time to react. We propose two novel architectures - the first combines a region proposal network on a lower-resolution image with a sequence network on the full-resolution image for efficient, accurate predictions; and the second combines a ResNet feature extractor with a vision transformer for high resolution tiled image classification. We also propose novel loss functions, combining a precise per-grid-element loss with a coarser per-image loss to achieve better precision in our detected fires without increasing the amount of false positives. With these techniques, we achieve state of the art results on this dataset with an accuracy of 89% and an average time to detection of 12 seconds.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring the fuel moisture content (FMC) of 10 h dead vegetation is crucial for managing and mitigating the impact of wildland fires. The combination of in situ FMC observations, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and satellite retrievals has facilitated the development of machine learning (ML) models to estimate 10 h dead FMC retrievals over the contiguous US (CONUS). In this study, ML models were trained using variables from the National Water Model, the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) NWP model, and static surface properties, along with surface reflectances and land surface temperature (LST) retrievals from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on the Suomi-NPP satellite system. Extensive hyper-parameter optimization resulted in skillful FMC models compared to a daily climatography RMSE (+44%) and an hourly climatography RMSE (+24%). Notably, VIIRS retrievals played a significant role as predictors for estimating 10 h dead FMC, demonstrating their importance as a group due to their high band correlation. Conversely, individual predictors within the HRRR group exhibited relatively high importance according to explainability techniques. Removing both HRRR and VIIRS retrievals as model inputs led to a significant decline in performance, particularly with worse RMSE values when excluding VIIRS retrievals. The importance of the VIIRS predictor group reinforces the dynamic relationship between 10 h dead fuel, the atmosphere, and soil moisture. These findings underscore the significance of selecting appropriate data sources when utilizing ML models for FMC prediction. VIIRS retrievals, in combination with selected HRRR variables, emerge as critical components in achieving skillful FMC estimates.},

ABSTRACT = {Dead fuel moisture content (DFMC) is a key driver for fire occurrence and is often an important input to many fire simulation models. There are two main approaches to estimating DFMC: empirical and process-based models. The former mainly relies on empirical methods to build relationships between the input drivers (weather, fuel and site characteristics) and observed DFMC. The latter attempts to simulate the processes that occur in the fuel with energy and water balance conservation equations. However, empirical models lack explanations for physical processes, and process-based models may provide an incomplete representation of DFMC. To combine the benefits of empirical and process-based models, here we introduced the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and its combination with an effective physics process-based model fuel stick moisture model (FSMM) to estimate DFMC. The LSTM network showed its powerful ability in describing the temporal dynamic changes of DFMC with high R2 (0.91), low RMSE (3.24%) and MAE (1.97%). When combined with a FSMM model, the physics-guided model FSMM-LSTM showed betterperformance (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 2.21% and MAE = 1.41%) compared with the other models. Therefore, the combination of the physics process and deep learning estimated 10-h DFMC more accurately, allowing the improvement of wildfire risk assessments and fire simulating.},
